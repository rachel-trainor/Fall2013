auth_overflow1
	Access Granted when using any password of length 17-27
	Access Granted, but a segfault, when using any password of length 28-31
	Segfault when using any password of length 32
	Buffer is length 16
	Auth flag gets overwritten when buffer is overflown

	Be able to explain how the stack works. 
	- ebp, esp, return address, local variables

auth_overflow2
	Switching the position of auth_flag and password_buffer doesn't fix the problem because this compiler places local variables on the stack in the same order.
